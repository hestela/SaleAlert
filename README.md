SaleAlert
=========

This program was for a programming challenge for Zappos.

This program takes either a Zappos item id or name and alters the user when the item goes on sale, or the price is reduced. The program stores the previous price and checks if it has been reduced. All of the data from the Zppos API comes in JSON format, and I used GSON to format the read data into a class.
