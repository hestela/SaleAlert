SaleAlert
=========

Zappos challenge for Java Developer internship
Created by Henry Estela

this program's jar file can be run in windows with the command java -jar SaleAlert.jar

> NOTE: the use of gson is licensed by Apache License 2.0
> actual email was also not possible because of API limitations, so the program just outputs some text
> representing an email

> this code is able to be expanded to get any json request from the API, only two different API calls
> were required for this program
> since "Java Application" was not clearly defined, I opted for a Java Console application and not for a GUI
> program is set to only get 3 json queries about a specific item and then terminate, can be modified to 
> loop indefinitely. There is a 10 second pause before each query.
